You can watch the video on youTube at https://youtu.be/TigucQFgnjo

1) Add "Meshes/Elevator1/sm_bottom_Frame"  to your scene

2) Add "Meshes/Elevator1/sm_middle_Frame"  to your scene. Place it above the "sm_bottom_Frame" piece.

3) Add "Meshes/FloorPiece"  to your scene. Position it so it is at the same height as "sm_middle_Frame".

4) Add "Blueprints/Elevator1/BP_DoorFrame" to your scene. Place it at the same height as "sm_middle_Frame".

5) Add "Blueprints/Elevator1/BP_Elevator_System" to your scene. Place it at the same height as "sm_middle_Frame". It's important
that the "BP_Elevator_System" prefab is at the same height as the FIRST floor of your elevator system.

6) Click on the "BP_DoorFrame" blueprint inside your scene and specify the following variables
"Time To Wait At Floors"  ( measured in seconds )
"Door Speed"	( ranges from 1 --> 10 )
"Floor Number"  ( since this is the first floor, just leave it at 1 )

7) Click on the "BP_Elevator_System" prefab in your scene and specify the following variables
"Time To Wait At Floors"
"Door Speed"   		( ranges from 1 --> 10 )
"Elevator Speed"	( ranges from 1 --> 10 )

8) Add more floors by doing the following copying / pasting the following objects that are already in your scene
"sm_middle_Frame"
"BP_DoorFrame"
"FloorPiece"

9) When you are done adding all the floors you want for this system. Click on each door frame in your scene and 
specify the "Floor number"  for each door frame.

10) Add "Blueprints/Elevator1/BP_TopFrame"  to the top of your elevator system. Click on the BP_TopFrame blueprint
and make sure "Elevator System" variable is pointing to your "BP_Elevator_System"  blueprint in your scene.

11) Click on your "BP_Elevator_System"  and edit the "Array Door Frames" variable. Add new elements according to how many
floors your elevator system has. IMPORTANT NOTE.. You need to add one extra element more than the actual number of floors
in your elevator system. 

For example, if you have 5 floors. You need to have 6 array elements in "Array Door Frames".

Once you added the correct number of elements. 
Click on "Array Element 0" and make it point to the "BP_DoorFrame" for your first floor.
Click on "Array Element 1" and ALSO make it point to the same BP_DoorFrame as your first floor.
Click on "Array Element 2" and make it point to the BP_DoorFrame as your 2nd floor.
Keep doing the following for the rest of the Array elements.



12) Press Play and test the elevator.

13) If you want to reposition the elevator buttons, you can click on the "BP_Elevator_System" in your scene and edit
the variable "Button Offset Position".  This vector will move all of the buttons.
The X variable will move the buttons Left(+)  or Right(-)
The Y variable will move the buttons in / out ( you should leave this at ZERO unless you want the buttons to float :)
The Z variable will move the buttons UP(+)  or Down(-)



14)  To create Elevator System 2, just repeat the same steps in here but use the "Elevator2" folders instead of the "Elevator1"
